# kumabot

This is a slack bot I'm running on my personal slack to organize my life.

 - `reminder.js` sends reminder message at specified time (like "reminber to pay bills!")
 - `weather.js` posts the current weather at 8:30 everyday & return forecast when asked.
 - `twitterlist.js` grab tweet's from my twitter list & post it to specific slack channel
 - `kaomoji.js` is just bot being cute
